# gettext-ts

gettext-ts is a lightweight but complete and accurate GNU gettext typescript
port for Node.js and the browser. Manage your i18n translations the right way in your JavaScript projects.

It was ported from [gettext.js](https://github.com/guillaumepotier/gettext.js/)
Eval function for plural is removed and `Intl.PluralRules`, a simple function parser or user
provided function instead.
